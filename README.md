# Trackd

Trackd is a fun way to share music and appreciate people's music selection.

General concept - there is a daily theme which consists of some kind of prompt. In this example, it is "stole the moon". The user base will then select a song they believe fits the theme, for example the Despicable Me song. Once submitted, it will be added to a global ranking to be voted for the best fitting song. 

To be developed: 
- own customizable icon
- my favorite artists
- current fav song
- one playlist

the home page also has quick glance things like "my top 5 artists in the last 4 weeks"
Currently name of the app is Trackd, a play off of “music tracks”.
