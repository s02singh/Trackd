# Trackd

Trackd is a fun way to share music and "rank" people's music selection.

General concept - there is a daily theme which consists of some kind of prompt. In this examplem it is "stole the moon". The user base will then select a song they believe fits the theme, for example the Desipicable Me song. Once submitted, it will be added to a global ranking to be voted for the best fitting song. Users will get earn points for their votes which can later be used to purchase nice icons and profile elements.

To be developed: 
- own customizable icon
- my favorite artists
- current fav song
- one playlist

the home page also has quick glance things like "my top 5 artists in the last 4 weeks"
Currently name of the app is Trackd, a play off of “music tracks”.
